# ECH Interoperability Report

This repo describes current ECH interoperability. 

The main useful thing should be the [ECH interop report](ech-interop-report.pdf).

The (latex/md) [source](./source) for that is also here.
If you have any corrections or additions (both are welcome), submitting
those as PRs on the latex source would be ideal. Or you can open an
issue.
