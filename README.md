# ECH Interoperability Report

This repo has the source for a report that describes current ECH
interoperability. 

There are two versions of the report:

- January 2025 [ECH interop report](ech-interop-report.pdf) 
  ([latex/md source](./source))
- September 2025 [ECH interop report](./source2/ech-interop-report-2.pdf).
  ([latex/md source](./source2) - early days, just being started now)

If you have any corrections or additions (both are welcome), submitting
those as PRs on the latex source would be ideal. Or you can open an
issue.
