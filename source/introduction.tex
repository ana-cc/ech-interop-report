\section{Introduction}

Deployments of the Transport Layer Security (TLS~\cite{rfc8446}) protocol
expose the name of the server (e.g. the web site DNS name) via the Server Name
Indication (SNI) field in the first message sent (the ClientHello).  The
Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)~\cite{draft-ietf-tls-esni} extension to TLS is a
privacy-enhancing scheme that aims to address this leak.

This report describes the current state of ECH interoperability.
