\section{Introduction}

Deployments of the Transport Layer Security (TLS~\cite{rfc8446}) protocol
expose the name of the server (e.g. the web site DNS name) via the Server Name
Indication (SNI) field in the first message sent (the ClientHello).  The
Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)~\cite{draft-ietf-tls-esni} extension to TLS is a
privacy-enhancing scheme that aims to address this leak.

The Open Technology Fund (OTF)~\footnote{\url{https://www.opentech.fund/}} have
funded the DEfO project~\footnote{\url{https://defo.ie}} to develop 
ECH implementations for OpenSSL, and to otherwise encourage implementation
and deployment of ECH.  This report is a deliverable for the DEfO project
and describes the current state of ECH interoperability.

As we expect the implementation and deployment environment for ECH to change
over time, this report will be updated as events warrant and is currently
versioned based on the build-time of this PDF. The latest version can be found
at
\url{https://github.com/defo-project/ech-interop-report/blob/main/ech-interop-report.pdf}.
Comments, additions or corrections are welcome. Those can be sent via email to
the author, or as issues or PRs (preferably for the latex files) in the github
repository for this report which is
