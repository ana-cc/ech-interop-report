\section{Interoperability}

Our primary interoperability testing is based on our ``smokeping''-like tests.
While smokeping measures latency for names/addreses, our tests aim to establish
whether and which ECH configurations interoperate or fail to do so.

We mainly do this via a set of hourly cronjobs running on the test.defo.ie VM
that attempt to access 67 URLs (some deliberately with broken configurations)
from six different clients (described in Table \ref{tab:smclients}. We report
results for the most recent 6 runs at
\url{https://test.defo.ie/smokeping-summary.php}.

The set of 67 test URLs covers all of the server technologies listed in Table
\ref{tab:servers}) though as all of those use OpenSSL for ECH, we direct most
of the URLs towards one nginx instance, typically both (via a haproxy instance
on) port 443 and direct to the nginx instance on port 15443. The set also
include URLs for the test services listed in Table \ref{tab:testservers}.  Some
test URLs have ``broken'' configurations, e.g. with badly encoded HTTPS
resource records, or have specification-conformant configurations that we
expect may not work.

We have 6 clients testing hourly against 67 URLs, giving us 402 measurements
per hour. The full set of URLs are too long to explain in detail here so
we'll just show current results and describe a few cases where those results
are more ``interesting''. The full set of URLs and the last 6 hours of test
outcomes at \url{https://test.defo.ie/smokeping-summary.php} or 
web pages with (most of) the test URLs loaded via an Iframe can be accessed at
\url{https://test.defo.ie/iframe_tests_sort.html}. That web page also includes
some explanatory text about each test URL.

Table \ref{tab:itests} below shows, for each test URL and each client,
the percentage of expected and total results for a recent two day
interval.~\footnote{Table \ref{tab:itests} is produced
using \url{https://github.com/defo-project/ech-dev-utils/blob/main/scripts/smokeping-summary-report.py}.}
