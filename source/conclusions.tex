\section{Conclusions}

Based on all the above, we can reach some conclusions:

\begin{itemize}

    \item
        At the ECH protocol level, interoperability, ignoring broad ECH
        ciphersuite support, is very good. The (real) issues in getting
        interoperable wide deployment of ECH revolve around complexity in HTTPS
        RR processing.

    \item
        If deploying ECH: Keep it simple, because ECH ciphersuite handling is
        not at all flexible in many clients. Only publish a ``singleton''
        ECHConfigList in one HTTPS RR and use x25519/HKDF-SHA256/AES128 for
        that one ECHConfig. If rotating ECH keys, do keep ``old'' private
        value usable at servers for a time that is a multiple (e.g. 3x or
        5x) of the duration for which the ``current'' ECH public value is
        to be used. It's probably wise to also have a shorter TTL on 
        HTTPS RR values, perhaps half of the key rotation duration or less.

    \item
        It is very non-trivial for non-browser clients to fully handle HTTPS
        RRs.  For typical non-browser clients HTTPS requires a change from the
        very simple situation of using the system resolver for A/AAAA RRs to a
        new situation where far more comlpex HTTPS processing may be needed. We
        expect a possibly long transition period where such clients have very
        simplistic processing of HTTPS RRs for ECH, likely just processing a
        single HTTPS RR value. Again: deployers will need to keep it simple,
        and possibly for an extended period.

    \item
        Browsers are complex beasts. It is very likely that real browser
        behaviour will be better than indicated in our test results above,
        which all involve ``cold'' caches. Nonetheless, it seems at this time,
        that one could not be 100\% confident that ECH will always be used, and
        always succeed, for browser users, even with the most conservative
        deployment. However, one can likely be confident that in such
        scenarios, ECH will typically be used and will typically succeed.

\end{itemize}

As a last word, the author is happy to speculate that had a far simpler
form of ECH been developed as a first version, with no options at all,
and had that design been deployed and iterated upon, we would be much
closer to seeing ECH widely deployed today with excellent interoperability.
The lesson there however, is for protocol designers, and not for those
implementing and deploying the current ECH specification, who are the
main target for this document.
