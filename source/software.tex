\section{Software}

This section describes libraries, clients and servers that support ECH.

\subsection{Libraries}

The libraries listed in Table \ref{tab:echlibs} have some support for ECH.  Of
the libraries listed, ECH support for all of the OpenSSL variants, python and
libcurl were developed by the DEfO project.

\subsection{Clients}

Current versions of firefox (e.g. 133.0, used in our smokeping tests) and
chromium (version 131.0.6778.85 is used in our tests) support ECH by default.
Other chromium-derived browsers also support ECH, while we don't include them
in our ongoing tests described below, we have manually verified that current
versions of vivaldi, brave and opera also have ECH support.  The Tor browser (a
firefox derivative) doesn't seem to support ECH by default.
To test if a browser supports ECH one can visit \url{https://test.defo.ie/}
or, for much more detail \url{https://test.defo.ie/iframe_tests.html}.

Browsers in general are still somewhat quirky in terms of whether or not
ECH will succeed, even when ECH is properly setup. This seems at least
partly due to the delay that can inherently occur between the browser
receiving DNS answers for A/AAAA records, and the time at which the
browser receives a DNS answer for an HTTPS record (containging ECH
information). It seems to be the case that browsers may be ``impatient''
in that they start the TLS session without attempting ECH if that
delay is too long, and that that happens sufficiently often to be
noticeable.

The only command line tool supporting ECH of which we're aware is curl. The
DEfO project
contributed ECH code as an experimental feature for curl that was merged to the
master branch in April 2024. As an experimental feature, ECH is not built by
default nor part of a release, so is only currently available to those who
build from source. Curl supports using OpenSSL, boringssl or Wolfssl libraries
for ECH.  Build instrucftions are at
\url{https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/ECH.md}.

As a scripting tool, often used as part of a TLS client, Python also fits here.
The DEfO project Cpython build adds ECH support to python via the OpenSSL
library.  That build is available at
\url{https://github.com/defo-project/cpython} with the new APIs required for
ECH described at
\url{https://irl.github.io/cpython/library/ssl.html#encrypted-client-hello}.

\subsection{Servers}

The servers listed in Table \ref{tab:servers} support ECH. In each case,
the ECH integration, using OpenSSL, was developed as part of the DEfO
project.
