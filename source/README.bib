This is the strews global bib repo.

To use this make a link from your document source directory.
For example $TOP/Work\ Package\ 2/D1.1.1/src/bib links to
here, and the dissem.tex in that directory refers to bib/rfc
for example.

A fresh rfc.bib can be downloaded from http://www.tm.uka.de/~bless/bibrfcindex.html
This one is from 20180328

I got the tcl script to make i-d.bib from https://sites.google.com/site/ea1dof/bibtex
on 20131009

But Elwyn did better so just run id2bib.py to update the I-Ds file.
